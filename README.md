# Keyless-Car-with-JavaScript 

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a small project I created with a few lines of JavaScript that only lets a user drive if they are over 18.

If they are below 18, they will get an alert that says, "Sorry, you are still too young to drive. Powering off...". 
If they are 18, they will get an alert that says, "Congratulations! You're old enough to drive now. Enjoy the ride!".

If they're above 18, they will get an alert that says, "Enjoy your ride. Powering on..."
